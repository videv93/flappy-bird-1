## Session Overview

**Topic:** SaaS app for tracking books read over time, with online collaboration between users during reading

**Goals:**
- Personal book tracking & reading history across years
- Social/collaborative experience connecting readers
- Fun, engaging user interactions around shared reading

**Approach:** Random Technique Selection - embracing creative serendipity

## Core Product Vision

A book tracking app that solves reader loneliness, rewards comprehension over consumption, connects readers with indie authors, and makes reading feel like a social adventure rather than a solitary chore.

**Unique Value Proposition:**
"The only reading app where understanding matters more than counting, where authors actually show up, and where you never read alone."

## Technique Execution Results

### Technique 1: Alien Anthropologist

**Key Discoveries:**
- Book tracking is about ACCOMPLISHMENT + MEMORY + SOCIAL SIGNALING
- Readers are LONELY during reading - they crave connection
- Questions emerge while reading with nowhere to ask them
- "Twitch for Reading" concept - silent co-presence has value
- Competition should be on COMPREHENSION not speed
- Authors as judges provides ultimate validation
- Indie authors FIRST - they crave reader connection

**Breakthrough Insight:** The app isn't just a tracker - it's a LONELINESS CURE for readers and a CONNECTION BRIDGE to authors.

### Technique 2: Cross-Pollination

**Raids Completed:**
- **Strava:** Activity feeds, session logging, kudos, reading FOMO
- **Discord:** Book servers, chapter channels, presence, silent reading rooms, voice events
- **Duolingo:** Streaks, XP, leagues, daily goals, guilt mascot, friend quests

**Breakthrough Insight:** Combine comprehension-based leagues + chapter-safe Discord channels + Strava-style feeds = something NO app has done.

### Technique 3: Pirate Code Brainstorm

**Wild Mashups Created:**
- Spotify Wrapped + Reader Dating = Reading identity + compatibility matching
- Pokemon Collecting + Book Badges = Collectible book creatures that evolve with comprehension

**Breakthrough Insight:** Radical differentiation through rule-breaking (hide book counts, reward slow reading, no star ratings).
